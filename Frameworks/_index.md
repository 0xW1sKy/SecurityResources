## Superficial Security Frameworks:

ITIL - Information Technology Infrastructure Library
	Continual Service Improvement

COSO - Committee of sponsoring organizations
	All about financial Fraud

COBIT - Control objectives for Information and related Technologies
Developed by ISACA
Auditors use this to define what controls you should have




## Real Security Frameworks

ISO 27000
	ISO/IEC 27000
		General Overview

			Information security management systems
			Overview and vocabulary

	ISO/IEC 27001
		Actual standard, includes ISMS and Requirements

			Information technology - Security Techniques - Information security management systems
			Requirements. The 2013 release of the standard specifies an information security management system in the same formalized, structured and succinct manner as other ISO standards specify other kinds of management systems.

	ISO/IEC 27002
		Listing of example controls that could be used to meet 27001 requirements

			Code of practice for information security controls
			essentially a detailed catalog of information security controls that might be managed through the ISMS

	ISO/IEC 27003
		Information security management system implementation guidance

	ISO/IEC 27004
		Guidelines for metrics
			Information security management
			Monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation

	ISO/IEC 27005
		Information security risk management
		(NIST SP800-39)

	ISO/IEC 27006
		Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of information security management systems

ISO 22301
	Information technology -- Security techniques -- Guidelines for information and communication technology readiness for business continuity

NIST SP-800
	US Specific
	Not as heavily placed into the CISSP test any more as the test is meant to be 'international'



## Compliance Frameworks

PCI-DSS
	Actual Standard: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf
		Review requirements 1-12 and Appendix A

	Only applies to organizations that do business directly with members of the PCI council. (i.e. VISA, MasterCard, Discover, etc.)

	PCI is not a law, it is a contract.

	PAN - Primary Account Number
		Credit Card Number, Expiration Date, CVV

	Tokenization
		Replace confidential information with placeholders for identification ("tokens")
		e.g. replace the credit card number of "0000-0000-0000-000" with "Token-CreditCard-1"

	QSA - Qualified Security Assessor
		PCI Auditors
