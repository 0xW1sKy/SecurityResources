title: Reference Monitor
---

Before a subject can get to an object, it should have a 'referee' i.e. something that grants or denies access.

### How to determine if something is a reference monitor:
    Can it block a subject from getting to an object?
      Yes: It is a reference monitor
      No: it is not a reference monitor.
