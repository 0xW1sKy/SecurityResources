Ignore how strong/weak a control is.

Something is better than nothing.

Consider the strength of a control as if it were a brick. Weak control = small brick, Strong control = big brick.

Regardless of the size of the brick, if you put enough of them together you have a wall.

Keeping in line with wall analogy, a wall would have multiple bricks at each layer, otherwise you'd just have a stack of bricks. If you only have 1 brick on each layer, you're only as strong as your weakest link.
