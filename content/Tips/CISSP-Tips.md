title: CISSP Test Taking Tips
---

- Read slow, read it twice
- Always assume Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
-Always assume a large company (100+)
- Don’t get wrapped up in US Law (in many countries, in some countries = ignore US law)
>Example: Reasonable expectation of privacy while using business systems. In US, there is usually no expectation of privacy. In EU, there is an expectation of privacy by law.
- If they don’t tell you budget is a concern, assume budget is not concern and go with the Cadillac answer
- Don’t forget about Physical Security (a lot of times a lock and key could be the best answer)
- Don't forget about availability
- Take breaks! If you don’t know what a question is asking, try taking a break.
- When the test asks about 'senior management': Unless told otherwise, assume they mean CEO, CFO, and board of directors.
- When we talk about accounting, we're talking about writing log entries and holding people accountable.
- When talking about auditing, we're talking about reading those log entries.
- When trying to decide between different answers, 1 answer will appeal to sys admin, 1 will appeal to manager. Pick the manager.
  > i.e. if you have multiple answers and 1 says 'do what policy says' that’s going to be the answer.
- If you come across a question and you think it's an easy win, read it again. It's probably a trick.
- Be aware of "Answer Bias"
  - If you read a multiple choice question, you have a bias towards A or B and bias against C or D.
  - Overcome this by reading answers first, and questions second.
