	2) Identify what's critical
	3) Map relationships between critical items and dependencies
	4) "Doing the math"
		a. Calculate "MTD" Maximum Tolerable Downtime
		b. Calculate "RTO" - recovery time objective
			i. Amount of time required to recover
			a. Can be split into 2 parts.
				1) Part 1 - RTO "amount of time to order a part"
				2) Part 2 -  'WRT' Work Recovery Time "amount of time to install the ordered parts
		c. Calculate "RPO" - Recovery Point objective
			a. If a problem is encountered, how much date/time are you able to lose? i.e. If you backups are every 24 hours, your RPO should say you're willing to lose up to 24 hours of data if you were to restore to the last backup.
		d. Perform Cost/Benefit analysis
