Risk Appetite
	How much risk is senior management comfortable taking on in the organization?


CISO
	- Manage security infrastructure
		○ Metrics - If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.
	- Advise Senior management on security risks

Metrics
	Comes from 2 places
	Measurement Variation
		- Don’t change the way you're measuring. Stay consistent to see trends over time.
	Process variation
		- The actual variation that is happening in the process


Policy
	- Brief, high-level statement
	- "Policy should never be longer than 2 pages"
	- Don't leave policy up for interpretation.
		- e.g. "We will be HIPAA compliant."

Standards
	"Bulleted list"

Procedures
	"Numbered list"

Baselines
	Minimum security configuration for different systems.
	Senior management is responsible for establishing baselines.
		Baseline info may be collected from vendors, open standards, etc.

	• Scoping
		- Go through everything a baseline talks about, decide what works and what doesn’t.
			§ Armed guards are too much for us, but security cameras is a good fit.
	• Tailoring
		- Make the baseline specific to your business.
			§ 16 cameras, 8 inside, 8 outside.


Guidelines
	Generalized ideas on how management would expect something to be completed that may not have a set of standards/procedures/baselines in existence
